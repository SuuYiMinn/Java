In this example app, we will simulate a simple email
system. A little background on what happens when
you send an email is explained in the lecture. Here are
the requirements:

1) Compose (Compose) menu:
    1.1) ask for "to email"
    1.2) ask for "from email"
    1.3) ask for "email subject"
    1.4) ask to write message body
    1.5) S (Send) or C (Cancel)

2) Check (Check mailbox)
    2.1) ask to enter email address of the account
    2.2) Show the list of received emails in the inbox
    2.3) R (read email) or C (Cancel)
        2.3.1) Ex for you: think about what should happen next when you choose to read an email
[Note: Like your gmail inbox, our simulation should also have indicator for read/not read status]

3) Sent (Check sent mails)
    3.1) ask to enter account email address
    3.2) show the list of emails sent by the account

Things to consider
    As discussed, we will have two email providers. One is Noodle Inc and another is Jabboo Inc.

    Each Inc will have email accounts of their customers.

    All Noodle Inc email account will end with noodle.com. All Jabboo account with jabboo.com.

    From what we have learned so far, what are a few other classes you can consider we should have.
